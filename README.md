# Loewe's x Ghibli (Howl's Moving Castle) web scrapping and analysis project.

⚠️ I am not affiliated with LOEWE HERMANOS S.A. nor do I claim any intelectual property upon the contents treated  ⚠️

The goals of this personal project are:

 1) Scrape the products sold in the Spanish Loewe's collaboration with Ghibli online store.
 2) Analyse the products and solve the following questions:
   - Which character is portrayed most?
   - What is the average price of the product per character?
   - What is the most prevalent product category (purse, wallet, t-shirt...)?
